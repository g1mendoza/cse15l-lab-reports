## Settting up your account

Last Step: for setting up your accout is to reset the password to one of your choice by clicking the link circled in red. *It might take some time for the account to fully work but for now changing the password is the first step.*

*once it looks like this you should be set to follow the next steps*

## Remmotly connecting
Step 1: From VSCode (*if using a Mac it should work as following*) select terminal and it you should open up a new terminal, check if the bottom right corner shows bash as part of it. 
*Look at the sections circled in the following image.*

Step 2: Now to access your CSE15L account from VSCode, you type in the following command into the terminal.

`$ ssh cs15lsp23--@ieng6.ucsd.edu`

*Where you replace -- with your actual username that you got in the beginning.*


Once you enter your username it will ask for you to type yes to continue to get access to the server. And entering the password will make your terminal look similar to the one below:

## Running Some Commands
## You are almost done!!!
You are able to test different command in this section, that were covered in lecture. Such as `cd, ls, pwd, mkdir, and cp`. You can type them into the terminal to get the outcome wanted:

These are some of the expected outcomes from the comands since there are no actual files that we are referencing to. Good practice would be to test them not only from this account but from our computer using the regular terminal.

*The End*
